# Custom Enumerables

Ruby code where the `yield` and `#call` methods have been utilized in order to recreate many of the `enumerable` methods using native Ruby code.

The `my_map_proc` and `my_map_options` methods are also created to allow for the `map` function with a `proc` or with either a block or `proc` respectively.
